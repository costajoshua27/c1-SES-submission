# jTrivia

## About

This is my submission for the January 2020 Capital One Software Engineering Summit (SES). Final applicants were asked to complete a [coding challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/jeopardy-api), in which you would build and design a trivia web application using the [jService API](http://jservice.io) that provides 100,000+ trivia questions from the popular game show Jeopardy!

## What I Used

* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) for the back-end framework
* [jService API](http://jservice.io) for the trivia question data
* [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) for front-end styling

## What I learned/Challenges

* The basic process of deploying a web application. I've personally done a decent amount of web development work but have never gotten to deploy an actual application and I honestly found it scary and daunting. This challenge gave me the opporunity to really learn the process and I feel a lot more confident about it now.

* How to build an intermidiately-sized Flask application. Once again, I've dabbled around with different web frameworks and have found myself to really like Flask, but I had never gotten around to making a substantial project with it. As I started to build this application, I found it increasingly difficult to keep track of every moving piece of the app, but I now feel more comfortable with the bigger scaled applications
